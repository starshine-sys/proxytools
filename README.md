# proxytools

A proxy bot written in Python. Mostly a way to learn Python, but who knows,
maybe Discord's intent changes will cripple PluralKit enough
for this to be needed (hopefully not).

## Running

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
To run it, run `proxytools/__main__.py`
while in the root directory of this repository.
